"""
Request schemas for API endpoints.

The new Tooliense SE-Agents framework supports two modes:

1. Basic Mode: Single Self-Evolve with context/constraints used directly
   - Generator receives context and constraints directly
   - Single Self-Evolve loop (default: 6 iterations)
   
2. Enhanced Mode: Professor with autonomous Function Calling + Specialist Self-Evolve
   - Professor autonomously decides what specialists to call via function calling
   - Each specialist runs their own Self-Evolve (default: 4 iterations)
   - Professor runs Self-Evolve for final synthesis (default: 2 iterations)
   - No manual task decomposition or specialist hints - fully autonomous

All evaluation is feedback-based using <stop> tokens (no numerical scores).
